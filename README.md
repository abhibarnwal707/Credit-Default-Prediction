# Credit Default Prediction Using SVM

In this project, we aim to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a given customer defaults on credit or not. Credit default is a critical issue in the banking and risk analytics industry. The prediction is based on various attributes such as:

- **Demographic data**: age, income, employment status, etc.
- **Behavioral data**: past loans, payment history, credit payment delays, etc.

## Project Files:
1. **credit-card-default.csv**: The dataset containing customer data.
2. **Credit_default_prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Key Steps:
1. Data cleaning and preparation to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
2. Building an SVM classifier to predict credit defaults.
3. Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Load the Jupyter notebook `Credit_default_prediction.ipynb`.
3. Use the `credit-card-default.csv` dataset to run the model and analyze predictions.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of SVM in predicting credit default, an essential tool for minimizing financial risk in the banking industry.
